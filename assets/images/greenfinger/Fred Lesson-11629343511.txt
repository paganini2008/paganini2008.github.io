Thanks for seeing me, it is nice 
to meet you!
Today we made introductions and worked 
a bit on common greetings.
We also got to go over some 
useful expressions.
You learned about some topics 
for business discussions.
To improve, keep a journal or diary 
in English and track your progress.
Sing along with your favorite 
English songs.
Hope to see you soon!
