# Customize your application

### Application Integration
-------------------------
**Step1**:  add dependency in your pom.xml:

``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.paganini2008</groupId>
  <artifactId>greenfinger-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
**Step2**: add <code>@EnableGreenFingerServer</code> on the main:

``` java
@EnableAsync(proxyTargetClass = true)
@EnableScheduling
@EnableGreenfingerServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class GreenFingerServerConsoleMain {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(GreenFingerServerConsoleMain.class, args);
	}
}
```
**Step3**:  Run it
